maybe rename api to services, or controller - api would be done by api doc/index.js

now: 

- finish queries
- finish api in index

- test db calls, test logic, test api
  - test logic around multiple copies
- error/exception handling (logic will probably be exceptions)

- test dockerfile

- go through TODOs

- make sure to sanitize input - prepared statements doing this in db - schema would work for api

- make centralized config
- work out a proper es package setup
- linter, logger
- autoreload for dev, automated testing
- discussion about code generators
- discussion about api format
- discussion about function naming format
