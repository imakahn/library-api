maybe rename api to services, or controller - api would be done by api doc/index.js

now: 

- finish queries
- make basic api in index
- test db calls, test logic, test api
- test logic around multiple copies

- make sure to sanitize input - prepared statements doing this in db - schema would work for api

- error/exception handling (logic will probably be exceptions)

- move all code into src/ folder - adjust package.json, docker
- make centralized config
- work out a proper es package setup
- linter, logger
