maybe rename api to services, or controller - api would be done by api doc/index.js

now: 

- finish queries
- fix migrations to link to user id - which means explicit user ids
- make basic api in index
- fix database stuff
- test logic w/errors - more, exceptions, given they are logic

- make sure to sanitize input

- error handling
- test db calls, test api

- make centralized config
- work out a proper es package setup

- water plants
