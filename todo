now: 

- finish queries
- finish api in server

- test db calls, test logic, test api
  - test logic around multiple copies
- error/exception handling (logic will probably be exceptions)

- test dockerfile

- go through TODOs

- make sure to sanitize input - prepared statements doing this in db - schema would work for api

- make centralized config
- work out a proper es package setup
- linter, logger
- autoreload for dev, automated testing
- discussion about code generators
- discussion about api format
- discussion about function naming format
- discussion ES module issues (including hilarious no-esm for tap)

- do I need a map.js for test coverage?
